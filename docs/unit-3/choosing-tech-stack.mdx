# Choosing a Tech Stack

# Choose a platform to build for

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Choice["Do you need access to hardware"] --> Yes
  Yes --> Disk["SD Cards, Drives"]
  Yes --> GPS["GPS Info"]
  Yes --> Accelerometer
  Yes --> GPUs
  Disk --> NativeMobile
  GPS --> NativeMobile
  Accelerometer --> NativeMobile
  GPUs --> NativeMobile
  Choice["Do you need access to hardware"] --> No
  No --> WebApp
```

# Choose a language

## If you want to target Mobile

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  NativeMobile --> Android
  NativeMobile --> iOS
  NativeMobile --> Both
  Android --> L1["Java/Kotlin"]
  Android --> Flutter
  iOS --> L2["Swift, Obj C"]
  iOS --> Flutter
  Both --> L4["Javascript For Mobile"]
  Both --> CrossPlatform

  L4 --> ReactNative
  L4 --> Cordova
  subgraph CrossPlatform
    L3["C# with Xamarin"]
    Flutter
  end
  subgraph Native
    L1
    L2
  end
  subgraph HybridMobile
    ReactNative
    Cordova
  end

```

## If you want to target Web

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  WebApp --> Choice["How much JS do you want to write"]
  Choice --> Little
  Little --> Python
  Little --> Java
  Little --> Ruby
  Choice --> Lots
  Lots --> L5["Javascript for Web"]
  L5 --> Express
  L5 --> NextJS
  L5 --> Create-React-App
```

# Choose an Architecture

## For simple needs

If you're ONLY going to be using Firebase Authentication & Firebase Firestore, you can usually cut out the need for a backend by relying on Firebase.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  App["Web or Mobile"] --> L1["Firebase Firestore"]
  App["Web or Mobile"] --> L2["Firebase Auth"]
  App["Web or Mobile"] --> L3["Firebase Cloud Storage"]
```

This makes it easy to get started if you feel comfortable working with tools like React on the Frontend.

There are some downsides:
* Releasing an update can take 12-24 hours over a large sample size
* No way of guaranteeing that someone updates to the latest version
* Not all 3rd party APIs support requests from the browser, but this works fine on Mobile
* Using API keys or other sensitive info from the Frontend is insecure
* Web and Mobile Apps cannot connect DIRECTLY to a database

## For more complex needs

Examples:
* If you need to integrate with a 3rd party API that requires an API key
* If you are aggregating data across multiple sources
* You need more control over the data used by your app

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  App["Web"] --> Backend
  Backend --> Firestore["Firebase Firestore"]
  Backend --> API["3rd Party APIs"]
  Backend --> Data["Additional Data"]
```

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  App["Mobile"] --> Backend
  App["Mobile"] --> Firestore["Firestore or other DBs"]
  Backend --> API["3rd Party APIs"]
  Backend --> Data["Additional Data"]
```


Tradeoffs:
* Setting up a backend is an additional app to manage
* You have to build your own security around your database or other 3rd Party APIs
* Updating the backend has immediate effects

## But dont do this

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  App["Web or Mobile"] --> Backend
  App["Web or Mobile"] --> Firestore
  App["Web or Mobile"] --> API
  Backend --> Firestore["Firebase Firestore"]
  Backend --> API["3rd Party APIs"]
  Backend --> Data["Additional Data"]
```

You have to make your calls to Firebase or other 3rd party APIs from 1 place, and not multiple places. This will be difficult to troubleshoot and manage!
