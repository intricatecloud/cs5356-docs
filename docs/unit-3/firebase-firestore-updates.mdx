title: Firestore with Real-Time Updates
---

If you'd like to incorporate some real-time functionality into your application - where you want to update the interface in real-time without having the user refresh the page or click a button, you can use the real-time features from Firestore.

## Listen for Changes in a Collection

Find the component that is making the queries to Firebase, and add the snippets below to that component

```jsx
import { query, onSnapshot, collection } from "firebase/firestore";

// Subscribe to updates once when a component loads
useEffect(() => {
  const q = query(collection(db, 'posts'))
  const unsubscribe = onSnapshot(q, (querySnapshot) => {
    const results = [];
    querySnapshot.forEach((doc) => {
        results.push({
          id: doc.id,
          ...doc.data()
        });
    });
    // update the state whenever a new snapshot
    // is available
    setResults(results)
  });
}, [])
```

* We can listen for changes to a collection by subscribing to a snapshot for a particular query
* When the collection is updated, the `onSnapshot` callback will be called with the latest results of the query
* Then the local state is updated with the latest results causing React to re-render the component with the latest info
